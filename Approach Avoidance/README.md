# Approach Avoidance Task

In the approach-avoidance task, emotional-picture valence (2: Valence: Negative (neg), Positive (pos)) was manipulated orthogonally with action goals (2: Action: Approach, Avoid). In each trial, participants were instructed to either pull the joystick towards themselves (approach) or away from themselves (avoid) according to the valence of the image (valence-action assignment was manipulated across blocks). 

This produced two contrasts of emotion-action congruence: 1. Congruent (Con): where the emotion-provoked action tendency is aligned with the instructed motor action goal and  2. Incongruent (Incon): where the emotion-driven action tendency was at conflict with the instructed motor action goal. Our aim was to test whether emotional valence facilitated movement as a function of motor-action congruence (indexed by reaction times, velocity and accuracy).
